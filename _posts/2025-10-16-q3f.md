I made a Quake 3 Fortress Beta1H server and you should play it! Follow these instructions to play!

`connect q3f.sourdani.dev`


# Instructions
- Download Q3F B1H
    - https://www.moddb.com/mods/q3f/downloads/quake-3-fortress-beta1h
    - Be sure to follow all the instructions including installing [ioquake3](https://ioquake3.org/)
- From within Q3F open the console by hitting the `~` key, type `connect q3f.sourdani.dev` and then press `enter`.

# Extra
I recently opened a [copyparty server](https://github.com/9001/copyparty) that hosts all kinds of [Quake 3 clients and more](https://dl.sourdani.dev)!

**Includes:**
- [ioquake3 for 32-bit Windows](https://dl.sourdani.dev/q3/win32/)
- [ioquake3 for PowerPC macOS 10.4](https://dl.sourdani.dev/q3/mac/10.4/)
